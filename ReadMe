This progran creates a shell that is able to support an interactive mode as well as a batch mode. It functions by utilizing the fork(), exec() and wait commands to
create a new process by forking off of the existing shell. This program supports dynmic reallocation of paths while also allowing users to specify the bin the wish to set.
It also contains several built in commands, namely exit, cd, and path which do not use the exec() command to execute.
